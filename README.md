All of the following assignments can be viewed at https://people.ucsc.edu/~atorre83/CSE_160/ 
- Click on the HTML file to view each project. 

These assignments were done using Javascript, HTML, and WebGl, and the Javascript 3D library Three.js.

ASG0: A web application that draws up to two vectors, with coordinates input by the user. Can also draw the resulting vector of various vector functions. 

ASG1: A simple web application to draw geometric shapes out of circles and triangles.

ASG2: In this project I created a blocky version of Falcor, from the film _The Never Ending Story_, by transfroming obejcts using matrices. There is also an option to animate Falcor which was created using a sin function. 

ASG3: In this Assignment I created a virtual world on a small plane. Falcor is in this assignment as well with the same functionality as ASG2. In the world you can move around using the W, A, S, D, keys to move up, left down and right, respectively. You can also use the Q, and E keys to pan left and right respectively. I also added some minecraft funcitonality in which you can place and break blocks using the z, and x keys respectively.

ASG4: This assignment uses a version of the same world with added lighting. It includes a button to turn lighting on and off, an animated point light that can be moved using sliders, and buttons to turn the normals on and off. The color of the lighting can be changed using RGB color sliders. Falcor and the movement in the world can be controlled with the same keys and buttons as mentioned above in ASG3.

ASG5: For the final project in this class I created a world using the Javascript library. This world is an ode to Melbrooks' film _Spaceballs_. The viewer can move throughout the world using the mouse, clicking and dragging to change directionn, and scrolling in and out with the middle mouse button, to zoom in and out.
